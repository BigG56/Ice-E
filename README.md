# Ice-E

## Description:
Ice-E is a full-stack PERN app made for the purchase of accessories such as rings necklaces and watches, the purpose of this app is to create a fast easy to use
web app to purchase and recieve products that are sold, creating this app has helped me understand the flow and structure of creating a full-stack app. Hopefully
after some work on the app i can add some features to help make the app easier to use and more accessable for people with disabilities such as a colorblind
setting or text reader for the users with eye-sight issues.

## How to use:
Start back-end - In the /server folder, run npm install into the terminal to download the packages needed.
                 Then in the terminal, to run dev enter npm run dev with nodemon or to start server, node server.js.
                 
Start front-end - In the /views folder run npm install into the terminal to download any packages needed.
                  Then run npm start to start the client-side app.
